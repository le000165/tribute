        A Brief Timeline of Events in Alan Turing's life
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          1912 Born on June 23rd in Maida Vale, London while his father, Julius
          Mathison Turing (1873–1947), was on leave from his position with the
          Indian Civil Service.
        </li>
        <li>
          1922 Turing was educated at Hazelhurst Preparatory School, an
          independent school in the village of Frant in Sussex (now East
          Sussex).
        </li>
        <li>
          1926 he went on to Sherborne School, a boarding independent school in
          the market town of Sherborne in Dorset.
        </li>
        <li>
          1928 aged 16, Turing encountered Albert Einstein's work; not only did
          he grasp it, but it is possible that he managed to deduce Einstein's
          questioning of Newton's laws of motion from a text in which this was
          never made explicit.
        </li>
        <li>
          1931 After Sherborne, Turing studied as an undergraduate at King's
          College, Cambridge,[5] where he was awarded first-class honours in
          mathematics.
        </li>
        <li>
          1935, at the age of 22, he was elected a fellow of King's on the
          strength of a dissertation in which he proved the central limit
          theorem. Unknown to the committee, the theorem had already been
          proven, in 1922, by Jarl Waldemar Lindeberg.
        </li>
        <li>
          1936, Turing published his paper "On Computable Numbers, with an
          Application to the Entscheidungsproblem" (1936).[48] In this paper,
          Turing reformulated Kurt Gödel's 1931 results on the limits of proof
          and computation, replacing Gödel's universal arithmetic-based formal
          language with the formal and simple hypothetical devices that became
          known as Turing machines.
        </li>
        <li>
          1939 When Turing returned to Cambridge, he attended lectures given in
          by Ludwig Wittgenstein about the foundations of mathematics.[57] The
          lectures have been reconstructed verbatim, including interjections
          from Turing and other students, from students' notes.
        </li>
        <li>
          1939 Turing solved the essential part of the naval indicator system,
          which was more complex than the indicator systems used by the other
          services. Turing decided to tackle the particularly difficult problem
          of German naval Enigma "because no one else was doing anything about
          it and I could have it to myself".
        </li>
        <li>
          1942 Turing travelled to the United States and worked with US Navy
          cryptanalysts on the naval Enigma and bombe construction in
          Washington; he also visited their Computing Machine Laboratory in
          Dayton, Ohio.
        </li>
        <li>
          1943 During this trip, he also assisted at Bell Labs with the
          development of secure speech devices.He returned to Bletchley
          Park.Turing became a general consultant for cryptanalysis at Bletchley
          Park.
        </li>
        <li>
          1945 Turing lived in Hampton, London,[101] while he worked on the
          design of the ACE (Automatic Computing Engine) at the National
          Physical Laboratory (NPL).
        </li>
        <li>
          1947 he returned to Cambridge for a sabbatical year during which he
          produced a seminal work on Intelligent Machinery that was not
          published in his lifetime. While he was at Cambridge, the Pilot ACE
          was being built in his absence.
        </li>
        <li>
          1948 Turing was appointed reader in the Mathematics Department at the
          Victoria University of Manchester. A year later, he became Deputy
          Director of the Computing Machine Laboratory, where he worked on
          software for one of the earliest stored-program computers—the
          Manchester Mark 1.
        </li>
        <li>
          1950 During this time, he continued to do more abstract work in
          mathematics,[108] and in "Computing Machinery and Intelligence".
          Turing addressed the problem of artificial intelligence, and proposed
          an experiment that became known as the Turing test, an attempt to
          define a standard for a machine to be called "intelligent".
        </li>
        <li>
          1951 he turned to mathematical biology, finally publishing his
          masterpiece "The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis" in January 1952. He
          was interested in morphogenesis, the development of patterns and
          shapes in biological organisms.
        </li>
        <li>
          1952 he started a relationship with Arnold Murray, a 19-year-old
          unemployed man. Just before Christmas, Turing was walking along
          Manchester's Oxford Road when he met Murray just outside the Regal
          Cinema and invited him to lunch. On 23 January, Turing's house was
          burgled.
        </li>
